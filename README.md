Hi and welcome to the GitHub page for my blog.

The code that I provide complement my blog posts. I hope
that you find them useful in learning math and building
your own projects.

Unless I noted otherwise, I have written all code. I'd
much appreciate it if you cite my blog and code in your
medium of output, e.g. papers, code, your very own blog. :)

If you find a bug in my code or have suggestions for making
my code better and simpler, please let me know.


Isaac,
