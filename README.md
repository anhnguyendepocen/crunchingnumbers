Hi and welcome to the GitHub repository for my blog.

The code that you find here will complement my blog posts.
I hope that you will find them useful in learning math and
building your own projects.

Unless I noted otherwise, I have written all code, and would
appreciate it if you will cite them in your medium of output,
e.g. papers, code, your very own blog. :)

If you find a bug in my code or have suggestions for making
the code better and simpler, please let me know. Thank you!

Isaac,
