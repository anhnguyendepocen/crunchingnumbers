# crunchingnumbers
Hi and welcome to GitHub for my blog crunchingnumbers.live.

The code that you can find here complement my blog posts,
and I hope that you will find them useful in learning math
and building your own projects.

Unless I noted otherwise, I have written all code, and would
much appreciate it if you will cite them in your medium of
output, e.g. papers, code, your very own blog. :)

If you find a bug in my code or have suggestions on making
the code better and simpler, please feel free to let me know.

Thanks!
