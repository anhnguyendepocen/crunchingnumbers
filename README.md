Hi and welcome to the GitHub page for my blog.

The code that I provide complement my blog posts. I hope that you find them useful in learning math and building your own projects.

Unless I noted otherwise, I have written all code. I'd much appreciate it if you cite [my blog](https://crunchingnumbers.live) and code in your medium of output, e.g. papers, code, your very own blog. :)

If you have suggestions for making my code better and simpler, please let me know!
